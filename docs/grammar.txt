This document describes the instruction language that an OpenActa Server
accepts. A server is instructed to try and find specific data, which can
subsequently be manipulated before being served back to the client (in JSON).

Note that OpenActa is not a general purpose database system, and specifically
it does not follow SQL syntax (even though it may somewhat look like it).
The OpenActa grammar was chosen deliberately to make this distinction clear.

The foundational considerations were that the instruction language should be
straightforward to create and read, grammatically sensible English (normal
reading order, left to right), and be divided in "line chunks" similar to what
*nix systems use with their pipe (|) symbol to separate commands.

This way, a user (or script) can control what gets done (and in what order).
The user has to keep in mind that an optimiser may re-order and parallelise
command chunks as it sees fit (provided it delivers a similar outcome to the
non-optimised instructions), however this should not require any particular
effort. The capability to parallelise and optimise is inherent to the
instruction language, and the backend storage (Haystack).

Review the following example:

    FIND dest_ip MATCHING src_ip LIKE "192.168.%" SINCE LAST WEEK
    | GROUP src_ip CONTAINING SUM(dest_ip) sum_dest_ip
    | SORT dest_ip

The initial instruction (FIND) might be distributed across multiple backend
CPU cores (or even machines), depending on where the data "since yesterday"
resides (it can be across multiple Haystacks). This parallelisation can
vastly speed up instructions.
If the second (FIND) instruction is performed on multiple machines, it will
need to be combined first before any grouping can be applied. Similarly,
the third and final instruction (SORT) can only be performed on the full
result.

Another example, specifying a temporal range other than the "now" which was
implicit in the previous instructions:

    FIND src_ip,dst_ip MATCHING dest_port=443 BETWEEN 1 AND 3 MONTHS AGO

OpenActa's storage system Haystack is strongly temporal, and this is also
reflected in the instruction language: the temporal parameters are issued
separately from other conditions and must always be present. Thus, it is
strongly encouraged to specify a restrictive temporal range in each query.
"SINCE FOREVER" is valid, however the user can expect it to be very slow.
Similarly, requesting ALL fields from Haystack bunches is inefficient in
terms of processing, memory usage and retrieval speed, and accordingly
discouraged as well: its use should be restricted to exploratory ad-hoc
queries, not automated scripts. Instructions that don't contain appropriate
restrictions are automatically restricted to 1000 result lines by the server.

The latest data is not instantly available for search. It can not be expected
that an instruction retrieving the very latest data produce a consistent result.
